<h2>Welcome to the ClassWrite Writing Studio.</h2>

<p style="border-left: 1px solid white; display: block; padding-left: 10px; width: 400px;">
    ClassWrite's goal is to make broadly available a set of useful
    tools for classroom writing instruction, without requiring an
    expensive subscription or administrative buy-in. If part of
    your instruction involves the careful evaluation of student
    writing, especially in a variety of contexts &mdash; online
    (wikis, forums, blogs), formal (essays and research papers),
    creative (poetry, fiction, experimental) &mdash; then ClassWrite's
    tools are tailored to your needs.
